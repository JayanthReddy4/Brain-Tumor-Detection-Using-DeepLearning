# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-DeepLearning
AIM:

The main aim of this project is to develop a Automated Brain Tumor Detection System and
it is provided for the doctors for better treatment. By using Deep Learning Algorithm we can identify
the severity of the disease and provide immediate diagnosis.
To Develop a Model that doctors can use and give priority to the cases based on the severity of the
condition.To make the Health care affordable and Accurate.Decrease the severity of the disease.

INTRODUCTION:

A brain tumor also known as an intracranial tumor, is an abnormal mass of tissue in which
cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal
cells. Basically a brain tumor is classified into two types:-

• Benign(Non-Cancerous)

• Malignant(Cancerous).

Detection of tumor is done by performing biopsy, which is one of the conventional method to recognize
tumors, it will be performed by radiologist or clinical experts in pathology lab and it also depends
on one’s experience. Manual assessment of pathological changes is leading to human errors and time
consuming. It is time consuming process and it might lead to some of human error.
So, using our project we can easily identify the tumor within very less time and even minimize the
error also.

EXISTING APPROACH:

Patients with symptoms of brain cancer visit hospitals and get a appointment from a doctor
and get a his brain scanned through MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT(Computed Tomography).
After getting the scan we need to go to the concerned doctor and the doctor need to examine the
reports and give us the verdict but it depends on the experience and even may lead to some human
errors and its a time consuming process.

PROPOSED APPROACH:

In this Project we are proposing a Deep Learning classification technique using CNN to
detecting the brain tumor. This is a collaborative project of team of two where we are developing,
training and testing various CNN models along with some secondary work. Deep learning looks
promising because already various types of image classification tasks has been performed by various
CNN’s so, we can rely on Deep Learning pretrained models or we can modify some layers for better
Accuracy.
Our Project takes less time and even avoids the human errors which might occur sometimes in traditional
method.

FEASABILITY STUDY:

A feasibility study is a preliminary study, which investigates the information of prospective
users and determines the resources requirements, costs, benefits and feasibility of proposed system. A
feasibility study takes into account various constraints within which the system should be implemented
and operated. In this stage, the resource needed for the implementation such as computing equipment,
man power and costs are estimated. The estimated compared with available resources and a cost
benefit analysis of the system is made. The feasibility analysis activity involves the analysis of the
10
problem and collection of all relevant information relating to the project. The main objectives of
the feasibility study are to determine whether the project would be feasible in terms of economic
feasibility, technical feasibility and operational feasibility and schedule feasibility or not. It is to make
sure that the input data which are required for the project are available.

METHODOLOGY:

Firstly, we have collected the dataset of the Tumor images with the 2 classes (Yes and No).
 Necessary pre-processing steps will be completed with the dataset before training with our algorithm.
Once after training the model will be saved for testing and classifying.
User can upload the images of which to be classified and by using the saved model the images will be classified and predicted.

SOFTWARE USED:

Python: 
Python has an abundance of powerful tools prepared for scientific computing Packages like Num-Py, Pandas and Sci-Py area unit freely available and well documented. Packages like these will dramatically scale back, and change the code required to write a given program. This makes iteration fast.

Jupyter Notebook :
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that enables you to make and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more!
